# KickCast - Premier League Predictor

**KickCast** is a full-stack web application that predicts soccer match outcomes using statistical modeling. By leveraging historical match data and the **Poisson Distribution**, it calculates the probabilities of wins, draws, and losses, alongside the most likely specific scorelines.

The application features a Python Flask backend for data processing and simulation, served to a responsive Bootstrap frontend with Chart.js visualizations.

## How It Works: The Analysis Logic

KickCast does not rely on random guessing. It uses a mathematical approach to determine the "Attack Strength" and "Defense Strength" of every team to calculate **Expected Goals (xG)**.

### 1\. The Mathematical Model: Poisson Distribution

Soccer scores are "rare events" that occur independently within a fixed timeframe. This makes the **Poisson Distribution** the ideal statistical model for predicting scores.

The probability of a team scoring $k$ goals is calculated as:

$$P(k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!}$$

Where $\lambda$ (Lambda) represents the **Expected Goals** for that specific match.

### 2\. Calculating Team Strengths (The Inputs)

To find $\lambda$, the system first calculates relative strengths compared to the league average:

  * **Attack Strength:** (Average goals scored by Team A) ÷ (Average goals scored by an average league team).
  * **Defense Strength:** (Average goals conceded by Team A) ÷ (Average goals conceded by an average league team).

These calculations are split into **Home** and **Away** contexts, as home-field advantage is statistically significant.

### 3\. The "Dynamic Season" Algorithm

One common issue with statistical models is early-season volatility (e.g., a team wins their first game 5-0 and looks invincible).

KickCast solves this using a **Weighted Transition Period** (found in `prosessData.py`):

  * **Early Season (\< 8 matches):** The model calculates a weighted average of **Last Season's Stats** and **Current Season's Stats**. As the season progresses, the weight shifts linearly toward the current form.
  * **Mid-to-Late Season (8+ matches):** The model relies entirely on the current season's data.

### 4\. The Simulation Loop

Once the inputs are ready, the simulation (in `simulationModel.py`) runs as follows:

1.  **Calculate Expected Goals (xG):**
    ```python
    Home_xG = Home_Attack * Away_Defense * Avg_League_Home_Goals
    Away_xG = Away_Attack * Home_Defense * Avg_League_Away_Goals
    ```
2.  **Probability Matrix:** The system iterates through a matrix of scorelines (0-0 up to 7-7).
3.  **Outcome Summation:**
      * **Home Win %:** Sum of probabilities where Home Goals \> Away Goals.
      * **Draw %:** Sum of probabilities where Home Goals == Away Goals.
      * **Away Win %:** Sum of probabilities where Away Goals \> Home Goals.
